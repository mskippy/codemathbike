  <h1>Unit 3: Game Development</h1>
  <p>In this tutorial you are going to create a top down shooter game using a game development software called <strong>GDevelop</strong>. It is an open-source no-code gaming software, but it will introduce you to some basic gaming logic that is needed when you are learning about programming.</p>
